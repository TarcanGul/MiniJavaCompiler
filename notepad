Tasks:
In execution, pop arguments from stack and add it to name table.
Then, return will push to stack.
After execution, current_value of the method exp node will be updated.
Type changes for some reason.
ListNode da class type yaptin. Var eklerken buna dikkat et.
You found that the class instance is not in the right scope.
Handle property.
Hanlde arguments.
Handle inheritance.
Handle array length.

P3:

You made while work! Awesome job!
Remaining: String concat, command line
Do string concat.
MALLOC instead of REALLOC (you are overwriting the string).
DO a temporary variable.
Somehow string operations for actual pointers don't work.
Then command line.
Command line
r0 => argc
r1 => argv double pointer *(base + offset)
