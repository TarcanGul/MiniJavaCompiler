Tasks:
In execution, pop arguments from stack and add it to name table.
Then, return will push to stack.
After execution, current_value of the method exp node will be updated.
Type changes for some reason.
ListNode da class type yaptin. Var eklerken buna dikkat et.
You found that the class instance is not in the right scope.
Handle property.
Hanlde arguments.
Handle inheritance.
Handle array length.

P3:
Don't use -nostartfiles! That was the error.
All you have to do in id's is to determine offset, store that value in stack and you would recall in assembly. 

Assignment works! 
Expression works even with bool! Move on to if and while. Only focus on int right now as much as you can. Make sure you add the switch cases but don't implement it yet.
Command line
You started good. Finish the execute assembly instructions, then move into expressions.
